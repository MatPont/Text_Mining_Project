# Text_Mining_Project

To reproduce the results of the paper you can do the following steps:

```./pipeline_preprocessing.sh```

it will call the "pipeline" execution of ```preprocessing_tools.py``` to do the pre-processing of the raw texts and the "base" execution of ```matrix_tools.py``` to make the bow and tf-idf-l2 matrices.
